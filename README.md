# dependency-parser

This is an implementation of a dependency parser using the shift-reduce algorithm. Part 1 implements the basic algorithm with a dummy oracle that uses the actual ground-truth labels. Part 2 uses a classifier to act as an oracle, and the results of the model are evaluated in Part 3.
